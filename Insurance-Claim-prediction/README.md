### Project Overview

 in this project, we are going to predict the Insurance claim using logistic regression. This dataset contains information on the insurance claim. each observation is different policy older with various features like the age of the person, the gender of the policyholder, body mass index, providing an understanding of the body, number of children of the policyholder, smoking state of the policyholder and individual medical costs billed by health insurance.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I got a better understanding of how to build a logistic regression model. In this project,  the following concepts were applied-

Train-test split
Correlation between the features
Logistic Regression
Auc score
Roc AUC plot


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The following steps were used in this project-
data loading and splitting
outlier detection
correlation check
prediction check
accuracy test
performance of classifier


### Challenges faced

 I had some problem with some syntax which i resolved by going through the python documentation page.


### Additional pointers

 Insurance claim predictor project was very knowledgeable. it gave first hand experience of how to do a project related to real life.

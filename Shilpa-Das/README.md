### Project Overview

 Google's Pagerank algorithm is the algorithm employed by Google to sort webpages without human evaluation. This can be done with the help of eigen value decomposition. The most fundamental idea put forth by pagerank's creators is that the importance of a page is judged by the number of pages linking to it.  We can calculate the top ranked page using the eigenvector decomposition , with the Power method and the modified power method.


### Learnings from the project

 On completion of this project I learned how Google googles a particular search using Pagerank algorithm.
It also brushed up my following skills:
-common vector and matrix operations
-vector and matrix products
-eigen vector decomposition.
Overall I had a great experience learning this topic and doing this project.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I used the following skills to do this project:
-basic of python
-common vector and matrix operations in python
-vector and matrix products
-eigen value and eigen vector decompositon


### Challenges faced

 I had some syntax errors which I overcame by re-evaluating my codes and for some errors I used the hints that were provided.


### Additional pointers

 I had a great experience working on this simple yet knowledgeable project which also evaluated the skills that I have acquired recently.
